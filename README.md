ENTHUSE: ENgine THrUst SurgE system
This repository contains scripts related to the functioning of ENTHUSE.

* response_sim.py simulates the increase to thrust responsiveness provided by ENTHUSE. It uses a PD controller to manage the hydrogen flow into the nozzle such that the aircraft reaches and maintains the desired thrust level within a couple of seconds instead of the 6+ seconds it usually takes engines to spool up.
